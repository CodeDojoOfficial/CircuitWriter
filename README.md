## Circuit Writer - A Digital Circuit Builder

Create a circuit using C++ code with this code package created by Adrian Gjerstad of CodeDojo.

- Several Base Components (Resistors, Capacitors, Gates, LEDs, Probes, ICs, and much more!)
- Create your own ICs with a simple class.
- Learn to make your first circuit in less than 15 minutes! (Implies prior C++ knowledge)
- Share your projects in the Gitter community!
- Distributed as raw source code! See the insides of the system! Make edits!

You can customize your system with simple coding skills!

## Installation

To install this code package, run the following commands in the command line:

```
$ git clone https://CodeDojoOfficial/CircuitWriter.git
$ cp CircuitWriter/src/lib MyProject/src/lib
```

Note that the code in this package is currently Linux safe only. If Linux specific code is released, we will try to release a Windows variant as well.
